# Google Cloud Application Integration Datastore adapter

## Description

Google recently launched [Application Integration Service](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/announcing-the-ga-of-application-integration) but currently it cannot connect directly to [Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore).

If you need to use Datastore, this repository contains a set of python Google Cloud Functions that can be used as a Cloud Function Task in your integration.

## How to use this

You can create a Cloud Function, setup a HTTP trigger and upload the source code as a zip folder or use the gcp command line.
