# What is this project?

Google recently launched [Application Integration Service](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/announcing-the-ga-of-application-integration) but currently it cannot connect directly to [Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore).

If you need to read or write Datastore data in your project, this repository contains a set of python Google Cloud Functions that that can be used as a Cloud Function Task in your integration.
